# Close Tabs to the Left Menu Item
Firefox extension that adds a "Close Tabs to the Left" tab context menu item in Firefox v78+.

## Overview
Installing this extension will add a _Close Tabs to the Left_ menu item to the root of your tab context menu, reducing some of the friction when closing tabs in Firefox v78 and beyond.

## Usage
Once this extension is installed and enabled, a _Close Tabs to the Left_ menu item will immediately be available when right-clicking on a tab.

This menu item can be triggered using the `l` access key. This means that the _Close Tabs to the Left_ menu item can be invoked by right-clicking a tab and pressing the `l` key on your keyboard.

Pinned tabs do not get closed when using this menu item.
